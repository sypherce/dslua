#summary This page explains the text output functions
=Text Output Functions=
 These functions are used to output text to the screen. To initialize a screen to display text, see the `Screen.LoadTextBG()` and `Screen.Initialize()` functions.

 * `TextBackground:SetColor()`
 * `TextBackground:PrintXY()`
 * `TextBackground:Clear()`

==`TextBackground:SetColor(color)`==
 Set the text color for that background. All previously printed text on the background will stay the same color, only the text that is printed after the `SetColor` function is affected.

 _*color*_ can be a number from 0 to 9. 0 = white, 1 = red, 2 = green, 3 = blue, 4 = purple, 5 = cyan, 6 = yellow, 7 = light gray, 8 = dark gray, 9 = black.

==`TextBackground:PrintXY(x, y, text)`==
 Print text to the screen.

 _*x*_ can be a number from 0 to 31. It controls where the text will start printing to, horizontally.

 _*y*_ can be a number from 0 to 23. It controls where the text will start printing to, vertically.

 _*text*_ is the string that will be printed.

==`TextBackground:Clear()`==
 Clear all text on that background.
