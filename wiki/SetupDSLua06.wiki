==Welcome to DSLua==

DSLua is a port of the Lua scripting language to the Nintendo DS. Originally made by waruwaru, now maintained by sypherce, daltonlaffs, and me, Jeremysr. You can get it or the source code from DSLua.com, on the download page. This document will explain how to use DSLua and write programs for it.

==CF Flavor==

DSLua comes in two flavors: CF flavor, and GBFS flavor. This section will explain the CF flavor.
